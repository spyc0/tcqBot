# tcqpBot.py
Random quote and pic Bot for pytiny

ID LIKE TO DO ALOT MORE WITH THIS BOT OFC, JUST KINDA EXPERIMENTING RIGHT NOW.
ID LIKE TO EVENTUALLY HAVE COMMAND FUNCTIONS AS WELL.

THERE'S AN ALTERNATE VERSION OF THIS IM PLAYING WITH AS WELL THAT CONNECTS TO IRC AT THE SAMETIME IT CONNECTS TO TINYCHAT. IT USES MY CUSTOM AIML LIBRARY HOSTED AT PANDORABOTS TO RESPOND TO USERS IN IRC, AND YOU CAN USE THE "SAY" COMMAND FROM IRC TO TELL IT TO POST SOMETHING IN TINYCHAT. THERE IS ALOT OF FUN THAT COULD BE HAD WITH AN IRC2TC BOT.
IM NOT READY TO POST IT TO GITHUB BECAUSE MY CODE SUCKS, BUT WHAT IS POSTED HERE IS IDENTICAL TO IT WITHOUT THE IRC FUNCTIONS. ONCE I CLEAN IT UP MORE ILL POST IT HERE AS WELL.

IF YOU'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT OR WORK ON THIS LIVE COME VISIT ME IN https://tinychat.com/scenegfag (IM "kayla")
OR IN IRC AT SERVER irc.oftc.net PORT 6697 CHANNEL #irc2tc (IM "kaykay")
